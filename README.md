# codec
Currently a repository of language data from far-right extremist and conspiracy communities. All data is freely available for use by researchers.

The most recent data are formatted with metadata in psuedo xml tags (<m> </m>). 
These tags should be filtered by the default settings in AntConc. If not, they can be changed in the "corpus manager" window.
Because of difficulties with BeautifulSoup, line breaks within posts are marked with <break>.
All values are separated with tabs.
