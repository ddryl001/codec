## Notes on data format

The most recent data are formatted with metadata in tags ("< m > </ m >"). 
These tags should be filtered by the default settings in [AntConc](https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/). If not, they can be changed in the "corpus manager" window.
Because of difficulties with BeautifulSoup, line breaks within posts are marked with "< break >".
All values are separated with tabs.
